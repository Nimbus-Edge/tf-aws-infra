This is how the project is configured:

    -- Client will hit our domain
    -- Route 53 will resolve the domain with ALB IP
    -- Sender will be redirected to this IP
    -- They will flow through VPC, IGW, and reach the public subnet
    -- Public subnet will have ELB
    -- ELB is attached with HTTPS 443 listener and ACM
    -- TSL Handshake is done and encrypted connection is set up
    -- ALB is also configured with empty Target Groups
    -- Auto Scaler will register Launch template's EC2 instances with target group
    -- Health checks will be triggered at Target Group level
    -- ALB will distribute the traffic to instances which are healthy
